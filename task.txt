Instruction for task
You need to implement an application that will perform next steps:
Receive a set of expressions from specified endpoint via REST call
Perform calculation of results for received set of expressions
Send a correct results to specified endpoint via REST call
Please note:
Each expression has limited lifetime. Expression will expire in 10 seconds.
You are free to choose any language. Still next languages are preferable: JS, Go.
You will have to provide your source code for review.

Example of get expressions request:

Endpoint:		https://www.eliftech.com/school-task
Endpoint mirror:	https://u0byf5fk31.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/etschool/task

GET

Response payload:
{
    "id": "587f3b48213a4f86a8dc017e7f7d72a2",
    "expressions": [
        "12 12 0 / 9 0 * + /",
        "5 0 * 10 - 6 / 6 - 9 +"
    ]
}


Example of verity results request:

POST 

Request payload:
{
    "id": "587f3b48213a4f86a8dc017e7f7d72a2",
    "results": [42, 15]
}

Response payload:
{
    "id": "587f3b48213a4f86a8dc017e7f7d72a2",
    "passed": true
}
Explanation for expression:
Provided expression is basically a set of operands and operators in Reverse Polish notation, also known as Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation. Next operations are supported (result of division should be integer (math.floor)):
“+” - this operand should perform next calculation with operands:
a - b
“-” - should perform next:
a + b + 8
“*” - should obtain a by modulo b (division by zero should return 42):
a % b
“/” - should perform next (division by zero should return 42):
a / b


Example of calculation for expression:
12 12 0 / 9 0 * + /
12 42 9 0 * + /
12 42 42 + /
12 0 /
42
